      I am an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The George Washington University, Washington DC. I am a generalist, working on `things` that interest me. 
      
      My formal training is in fluid dynamics. I am still passionately running experiments and doing some theoretical work in the field. Currently my fluid dynamics research is into biological fluid dynamics and cardiovascular flow.
      
      I taught a cross-disciplinary course titled, Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing. The course is extremely hands-on. It helped develop applications in cyber-physical systems and speech processing. 
      
      In addition, I taught courses for first year engineering students on the engineering applications of Raspberry Pi, Python programming and mobile App development inspired by social innovation potential during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

      I am here because of my experiences as a researcher, educator and immense support from family, friends and students.
      
      <!-- His research interests span the areas of human health and sustainable energy with focus on mechanics of biological fluids, low-cost energy technologies and applications of wavelet transforms. His current research work on biofluid dynamics of the cardiovasculature, rheology of biological fluids and applications of wavelet transforms has been supported by NSF and the Center for Biomimetics and Bioinspired Engineering (CBBE), GWU.

      <!-- He developed a wavelet transform-based computational code (PIVlet) for the analysis of complex vortical patterns encountered in arterial blood flow. He has extensive knowledge of experimental fluid mechanics and non-invasive measurement techniques such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), particle image velocimetry (PIV), schlieren imagery, magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) and molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV). Dr. Bulusu was recognized with the ASME Best Paper Award by the Advanced Energy Systems Division (AESD) Heat Pump Technical Committee and William and Louise Corcoron Award for contributing to the intellectual and social life of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, GWU. -->
